- 👋 Hi, I’m @dap0c0
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, linguistics, cybersecurity, and info-tech in general.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning basic networking on Python3 and penetration testing as a beginner.
     I hope to learn how to successfully integrate version control into my personal projects, as well
     as further my experience with Python libraries as it is a relatively new language to me.
    
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing, to be honest. I am an amateur programmer and pretty new to GitHub.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: Interstellar is my favorite film!
