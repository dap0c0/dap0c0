# About me.
Hi, I’m @dap0c0

I’m interested in computer science, linguistics, cybersecurity, and info-tech in general.

I'm currently learning basic networking on Python3 and penetration testing as a beginner. I hope to learn how to successfully integrate
version control into my personal projects, as well as further my experience with Python libraries as it is a relatively new language to me.

If you're just browsing around and happen to see some styling errors in my code,
I would kindly appreciate your feedback on how to better my style.

Pronouns: he/him

Fun fact: Interstellar is my favorite film!
